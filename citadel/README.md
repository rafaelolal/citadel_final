1. API that given any info will return as many parameters and their decision to either buy sell or hold a specific ticker.
2. API that given the results from the above API, gives numbers on whether to decide to buy sell or hold

# API 1

- Continue working on the technical analysis parameters I started
- Find other parameters to include
- Somehow decide on a strength for each parameter

# API 2

- Use the decisions made by each parameter and its strength to make a final decision
- Maybe strength should be stored within this API and not decided by `API 1`
